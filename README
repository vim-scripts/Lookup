Lookup is a plugin for vim script developers which provides functionality to
quickly and easily lookup docs for vim elements, or in the case of user defined
functions, commands, or variables, find the definition or occurrences of the
element.

While editing a vim file, you can lookup the element under the cursor using:

    :Lookup

You can also map this command so that you simply need to hit <cr> on an element
to look it up by adding the following to a ftplugin/vim_lookup.vim file in your
vimfiles directory (%HOME%/vimfiles on Windows, ~/.vim on Linux/OSX):

  if bufname('%') !~ '^\(command-line\|\[Command Line\]\)$'
    nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <cr> :Lookup<cr>
  endif

For more details please see the lookup vim docs (:help lookup).
